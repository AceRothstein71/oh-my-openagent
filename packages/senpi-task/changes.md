## 2026-08-06 — Make batch contention coverage scheduler-independent

The batch-admission contention test now injects the typed `contended` lease result directly instead
of depending on 40–120 ms renewal timing. The real renewable-lease behavior remains covered in
`admission-lease.test.ts`; this test is responsible only for proving that a contended acquisition
defers the entire suspended batch without mutating records.

Keep this separation when refactoring admission tests. Reintroducing wall-clock lease expiry into
the batch policy test makes the Windows CI result depend on scheduler pauses rather than behavior.

## 2026-08-12 — Export the shared child progress projection

The package root now exports `createChildProgress` and `ToolProgressDetails` so the OmO Senpi RPC
bridge and the terminal status UI derive live tool, assistant-line, turn, and token progress from one
implementation.

Do not fork the progress grammar or token tracker in downstream adapters; child event interpretation
must remain shared with the task TUI.
